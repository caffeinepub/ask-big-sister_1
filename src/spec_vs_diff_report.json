  "summary": "The diff adds a new /game route, navigation entry points (Header + HomePage), and implements a browser-based match-3 game page with an 8x8 board and 6 tile types. However, required generated image assets are not evidenced as added, touch interactions are not evidenced beyond click, and HUD elements (score/restart/instructions) are not fully verifiable due to truncation. The diff also includes broad global theme token changes that were not explicitly requested.",

      "reason": "The provided portion of GamePage shows the title/description and board rendering, but the side panel (where HUD/controls likely live) is truncated, so score display, restart control, and instructions are not verifiable from the diff summary alone.",
