  "summary": "REQ-1, REQ-2, and REQ-3 appear to be implemented via a new centralized auth hook (non-anonymous identity check), stable router creation and profile gating in App layout, React Query enablement/error-handling changes to avoid unauthenticated calls, and match-3 input locking plus position-based (stable) stone keys to prevent remount flicker during cascades. Several additional UI/styling and game-architecture refactors were also introduced that are not explicitly requested.",
